Hi Racketeers,

I included some optional questions in the voting for the community choice. 
As the responses were anonymous, and generally very positive and/or reasonable, I thought I’d share them with you.

I’d like to recruit a small team to run the next comp - ideally dividing up the tasks so they are small and fun and not onerous.

Have a look at the responses and contact me directly if you are interested.

How could the competition be improved?
 * Minimise the clicks needed to see the contestants' pictures.
 * More fish
 * Suggest more libraries to inspire people to try.
 * Have the pictures of each entry next to the choice boxes
 * Require actual image output for all entries so it's easier to vote
 * Include the output (picture) in the overview at the end of the competition for those who don't want to bother with downloading and running the code.
 * Send fewer emails
 * WITH MY ENTRY. IT WILL BE AWESOME. WOULD HAVE BEEN. WOULD WILLEN BEENISH.
 * I thought it was handled well.
 * unclear if i need to use metapict for this or not
 
Are there any other sorts of competition you would like to see?
 * Racket Gamejam competition - Racket low-level competition - Racket retro competition
 * Best Racket tutorial
 * Live coding! (Though I probably would not participate myself, but I'd be very eager to watch it!)
 * Racket-based MUD
 * Same thing, but using pict3d!
 * "THOSE WITH MY ENTRIES THAT I HAVE  A CHANCE OF WINNING. 
 * I'm having a lot of fun with your form."
 * I think the art competitions are great - perhaps animated stuff?
