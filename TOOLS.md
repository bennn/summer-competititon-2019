Having trouble? - ask a question on racket-users. You can also try stack-overflow and reddit but YMMV.

Libraries that can be used to make images:
* [Pict: Functional Pictures](https://docs.racket-lang.org/pict/)
* [2htdp/image](https://docs.racket-lang.org/teachpack/2htdpimage.html)
* [Metapict](https://docs.racket-lang.org/metapict/)   - 
* [Pict3D: Functional 3D Scenes](https://docs.racket-lang.org/pict3d) - go 3D!
* [Plot: Graph Plotting](https://docs.racket-lang.org/plot/) - a graph plotting library that produces lovely plots.
* [Lindenmayer](https://docs.racket-lang.org/lindenmayer) - _The Lindenmayer language provides a language for running and interpreting Lindenmayer Systems. In general L-systems are useful for modeling plant growth, procedural content generation, and making pretty pictures:_
